    <h1>The Truth About "Kate Schinckel"</h1>
    <p>
        Have you ever met Kate? Really met her? Think about it. Every time someone brings her up, it's always secondhand stories -<br>
        “Oh, Kate said this,” or “Kate did that.” or "Oh, yeah, we were there with Kate."<br>
        - but when you ask for proof, like photos, a text thread, a single shred of evidence of any kind? It all falls apart.<br><br>
        The truth is this people (prepare yourself for the bombshell):</p>
        <h2>Kate Doesn't Exist.</h2>
        <p>
            She's a <i>myth</i>, a fabrication, a convenient figment of our collective imagination.
            Don't get me wrong, it is a tempting lie, and I believed it for too long, just as you have. But these are the cold facts.
            No matter how much we want her to be real, she just isn't. There's no such thing, and there never has been.
        </p>
    <p>Ask yourself: why is it always <em>Kate</em>? Why not someone else? The name “Kate” is suspiciously common, easy to slip into conversations 
        without raising alarms. “Kate is late.” “Kate posted it the other day.” “Kate went to France last summer.” These phrases are too perfect, too 
        innocuous — like they were generated by an algorithm to blend seamlessly into human interaction. When you press people for details, 
        they hesitate. “Well, I didn't actually <em>see</em> Kate, but she left just before I arrived,” or, 
        “She has to go under Schmeichel McSchmeichel 
        cause she's a teacher, but that's definitely her Facebook.” Wake up. Cover photo of Kasper Schmeichel? More like Cover Story!
    </p>
    <h2>But Why, Though?</h2>
    <p>
        The real question isn't whether Kate exists—it's why we're being told that she does. Is it a marketing ploy by Big Schinckel to sell more name-brand 
        tacky shit? A POSWSC drone programmed to run the club (into the ground?)? A calculated move by Kris to not look so alone?
        Whatever the reason, it's time to open your eyes. 
        Kate isn't real. 
        She never was. 
        And the longer we let this charade continue, the harder it will be to uncover the truth.
        Don't be fooled as I was - The club runs itself, no one would love a board gamer no matter how nice they are, and Big Schinckel would stop at nothing to get their paraphenalia into the hands of consumers.

        What can I do to help?
    </h2>
    <p>
        The good news is just by reading this and knowing the truth, we're one step closer to being safe from whatever their plan is. Because now we have you, too.
        But there's more you can do in this fight for justice and truth.
